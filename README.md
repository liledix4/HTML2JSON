# HTML2JSON

Node.js script that converts HTML file to JSON file

1. Close ALL HTML tags! Even if they can't be, like `<br>`.
2. It's recommended to put the file to the same directory as the script.
3. Launch terminal from the script directory, and then run the `convert` command. Follow further instructions.
    - Alternatively, you can open `convert.bat` file (Windows only).
